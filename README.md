## Ideas
- Show timestamp of articles (prepared)
- Show tags (filter by tags) (add some db stubs/entities?)
- Markdown support for content but prevent attacks (advanced feature)
- Access logs (prepared)
- Pagination for articles (lot of ui stuff)
- Article detail page (with deep links)
- Show only article teaser on main page
- Edit existing posts (create /update)
- Authentication (users to db?)
- Filter curse words
- Like/Favorite Article (filter liked articles, sort by number of likes)
- Comment functionality
